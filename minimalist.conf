############## Main configuration file for Minimalist ################

#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
#          These directives can be used only in global config        #
#--------------------------------------------------------------------#

# The directory for Minimalist's files - default to /var/spool/minimalist
#
directory = /var/spool/minimalist

# The Minimalist administrator's e-mail address.
#
# Default to postmaster@primary_domain, where primary_domain is result of
# the `hostname --fqdn` command
#
#admin = doka@kiev.sovam.com

# Administrator password. It applies to all lists, regardless to
# authentication settings in these lists. For per-list authentication see
# directive 'auth' below.
#
# Password must be in very first line and first column of message's body,
# as follows (without quotes): '*password: this_secret_password'
#
# By default this password isn't empty, but undefined, so if you want use
# it, you must define it here.
#
#password = this_secret_password

# Address for return miscellaneous delivery errors
# Available values are:
# . drop - drop such error messages
# . admin - send error messages to admin (see above)
# . sender - send error messages to sender of original message
# . RFC-822 E-mail - send error messages to arbitrary mailbox
#
# Default to 'drop'. Note, that last value is quite annoying for message's
# sender and highly undesirable. When setuping new list it is desirable to
# set this parameter to 'admin' for revealing adimistrator's errors.
#
#errors to = admin

# Time while authentication request is valid, in hours
# Default to 24 hours
#
#request valid = 12

# Access control list, used for limiting access to Minimalist. Delimiter
# for items is ':'. Item, which begins with '@', means path to filename
# with items list, one item per row.
#
# Default is empty
#
#blacklist = !small.domain.com:domain.com:spamdomain.org:@/path/to/blacklist.txt
#
# In this example mails from small.domain.com will be allowed to work with
# Minimalist, mails from domain.com will be disallowed, and further, on the
# 'first match' basis.

# Log requests to Minimalist. Can be either "none" or path to logfile.
#
# Default to none
#
logfile = /var/log/Minimalist.log

#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
#  These directives can be used either in global and local configs  #
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Path to sendmail, default to '/usr/sbin/sendmail'
#
sendmail = /usr/sbin/sendmail

# Delivery method. Can be 'internal' - Minimalist will send message by
# itself and 'alias' - Minimalist will send message to specified address,
# which can points to bulkmailer, etc.
#
# Default to 'internal'. Syntax is:
#
#delivery = internal
#delivery = alias e-mail

# The domain name - default to `hostname --fqdn`. If begins with '|' then
# Minimalist calls external program to determine hostname.
#
#domain = |uname -n
#domain = kiev.sovam.com

# Security level:
# . none - allow any person write to any mailing list
# . careful - only subscribers can write to list
# . paranoid - user must authenticate subscribe/unsubscribe requests
#
# Default to 'careful'
#
#security = none

# Archiving strategy:
#  . no - don't archive articles
#  . daily - create new directory for articles every day
#  . monthly - create new directory for articles every month
#  . yearly - create new directory for articles every year
# or
#  archive = pipe /path/to/archiver [options]
#
# for instance
#  archive = pipe /usr/local/bin/hypermail -m www-talk -d /archives/www-talk
#
# Default to 'no'
#
#archive = monthly

# List's status. Available values are:
# . open - list without any restrictions
# . ro - read-only access to list
# . closed - only trusted users can subscribe anyone to this list.
# . mandatory - subscribed users can't unsubscribe
#
# Values may be used together, for example: closed,ro,mandatory
#
# Default to 'open'
#
#status = closed,ro,mandatory

# Copy to sender - indicates send or no message to message's sender
# Default to yes
#
#copy to sender = no

# This variable defines Reply-To: contents of outgoing message. Available
# choices: 'no', 'yes' or e-mail. If used 'no' (default), Minimalist doesn't
# touch this header at all. If used 'yes', Minimalist sets Reply-To: header
# to list's address instead of original contents.
# 
# The third choice is available ONLY in per-list config - if used any other
# value, Reply-To: will be set to this value. BE CAREFUL and use correct
# RFC-822 compliant E-mail here.
#
# Please check the following URL on why you (most often) should not use
# this feature: http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html (Thanks to
# Jonas Bofjall for pointing to this topic)
#
# Default to 'no'
#
#reply-to list = yes

# Set From: to specified value (RFC-822 compliant E-mail address) in
# outgoing message.
#
# Default - don't touch From:
#
#from = doka@kiev.sovam.com

# Modify subject before sending message to subscribers.
#
# Available values:
#  no   : don't touch subject
#  yes  : add "[list_name] " before original subject
#  more : remove leading "Re: " if it's there and then add "[list_name] "
#
# Default to yes
#
#modify subject = no

# Maximal count of subscribers per list, zero means no limits.
# Default to zero
#
#maxusers = 100

# Maximal count of recepients per message. If not zero, Minimalist will
# generate few messages with maxrcpts recipients instead of one message to
# all recipients.
#
# Default to 20
#
#maxrcpts = 15

# Delay (in seconds) between deliveries, if there are few ones per message
# (in case of use 'maxrcpts' directive)
#
# Default to none
#
#delay = 15

# Maximal size of message
# Default to none
#
#maxsize = 100000

# Include list information headers (RFC 2369) in outgoing mail. These
# directives are: List-Help, List-Subscribe, List-Unsubscribe, List-Post,
# List-Owner and, optionally, List-Archive.
#
# Available values are: 'no', 'yes' or URL, which points to archive, in
# form: <URL> (Comment)
#
# Example:
# list information = <http://www.yahoo.com/> (Archive of everything)
#
# Note: comment is optional and may be avoided. Using URL as value in this
# directive implies 'yes' to all rest List-* headers and available only in
# per-list config.
#
# Default value is 'yes'
#
#list information = no

# Strip various "Receipt Request" headers. Currently there are:
#
#  . Return-Receipt-To
#  . Disposition-Notification-To
#  . X-Confirm-Reading-To
#
# Default not to strip
#
#strip rrq = yes

# Add extra headers. It is possible to use this option two and more times -
# Minimalist will glue all these headers, when producing final message.
# Also it is possible to use macroses (if applicable) \a (admin), \d
# (domain), \l (list), \o (owner), \n (newline), \t (tab) and \s (space) in
# these headers.
#
# WARNING! Minimalist doesn't check validity of these headers nor their
# duplicating! Be carefull while using this option.
#
#extra header = X-BeenThere: \l@\d
#
# By using \n, \t and \s it is possible to construct multiline headers, for
# example:
#
#extra header = X-Multline: first line\n\t second line\n\t third line
#
# the same result may be achieved by combining few directives:
#
#extra header = X-Multilne: first line
#extra header = \t second line
#extra header = \t third line

# Remove 'Resent-*' headers in incoming mail. These headers are not
# important for message understanding and processing, but some MUA's
# generate incorrect these ones.
#
# Default not to remove.
#
#remove resent = yes

#------------------------------------------------------------------#
#       These directives can be used in local configs only         #
#------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Authentication scheme for list.
#
# NOTE: By default there is 'password' scheme with undefined password, so
# if you want to make administrative requests to list, you must define this
# scheme explicitly.
#
# Examples:
#
# auth = mailfrom doka@kiev.sovam.com:@/usr/local/etc/list.admins
#	List users, allowed to make administrative requests. Their e-mails
#	delimited by ':', item, beginnig with '@' means filename with list
#	of persons, one person's e-mail per one row.
#
# auth = password this_secret_password
#	Password, which opens administrative access to list. Must be in
#	very first line and first column of message's body, as follows
#	(without quotes): '*password: this_secret_password'
#
#auth = mailfrom doka@kiev.sovam.com:@/usr/local/etc/mml.trusted
#auth = password this_secret_password

# List's GECOS.
#
# Add gecos to headers 'To' and, optionally, 'Reply-To', when resending
# message to subscribers. For example, use:
#
# list gecos = Minimalist General Discussion
#
# for
#
# To: Minimalist General Discussion <mml-general@kiev.sovam.com>
# Reply-To: Minimalist General Discussion <mml-general@kiev.sovam.com>
#
# in outgoing message.
#
# Default: empty
#
#list gecos = Test GECOS
